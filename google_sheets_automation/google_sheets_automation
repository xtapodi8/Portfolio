This is an automation I created for setting up youtube campaigns more effienctly. 
I used Google Sheets, so it could be accessed by the global team and add the campaign info they were responisble for in the first Input tab.
Each tab serves as a connection to BigQuery to extract data from Salesforce or as an SDF that can be directly uploaded to DV360. 
Within the cells, numerous formulas are employed to combine and automate all the data.
